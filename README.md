This project demonstrates a hand gesture-controlled mouse using a combination of OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Python libraries. The application captures real-time video from the webcam, detects hand landmarks, and interprets specific gestures to control mouse movements and perform various actions like clicks, double-clicks, screenshots, and adjusting screen brightness.
